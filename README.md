# EdTech Africa

## Description
EdTech Africa is a learning platform for young children who want to learn English and Swahili.
It addresses reading, writing and arithmetic skills for young children, using gesture recognition,
text-to-speech and voice recognition.  As students perform well on exercises, they visualize 
animated stickers and score points. 

The target audience are young children in Africa who want to learn these languages in a fun, simple
and interactive way.  However, children in other parts of the world can use this application too.
EdTech Africa supports English, French, Chinese and Swahili device locales.  Students can
communicate with each other via Bluetooth within the app.
